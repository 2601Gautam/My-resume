<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Gautam! I'm currently pursuing my ICT degree at DAIICT. I have a passion for coding and have recently started a web development course, where I'm actively working on various projects. Besides coding, I love playing cricket, which is one of my favorite hobbies. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.</p>
